<h1>The Best Movies According to Vania</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
<p>It is not another conventional war film. The scenes are intense and suspenseful with extense dialogues. The plot develops on a ironic way with dark and witty humour. This film makes Quentin Tarantino's directing style grow on you.</p>
<h3>Split</h3>
<p>A psychological thriller directed by M. Night Shyamalan. James McAvoy performs brilliantly the as the main character of the film. Split is a part of the trilogy with other 2 films: Unbreakable and Glass, also directed by Shyamalan, but Split is indeed the best movie. The way the plot develops will keep you hooked until the last minute! It definitely worth the watch.</p>
<h3>The Menu</h3>
<p>A blend of dark humour, suspense and thriller, The Menu is indeed a feast you don't want to miss! Rich screenplay, magnificent production and hauntly brilliant!</p>
